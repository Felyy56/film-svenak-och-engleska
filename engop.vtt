Welcome to Go Kart Centralen. We're excited
to have you here for some high speed thrills.

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:11.579
Before you hit the track and try the sport of
go kart, let's go over some important safety

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:16.844
information. Please note that karting may not
be suitable for everyone and all driving is

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:22.650
at your own risk. If you're pregnant, have serious
health conditions or have consumed alcohol

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.027
or drugs, please refrain from karting. First,
Empty your pockets and put loose hanging clothing

00:00:29.147 --> 00:00:34.750
and any headwear that cannot be worn inside
the helmet in a locker. Now it's time to put

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.333
on your safety gear. If you have long hair,
tie it up and tuck it into your clothing to

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:46.597
prevent potential injury. Put on the balaclava
and then the helmet. This is your go-kart.

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:52.941
The accelerator pedal is on the right and the
brake is on the left. Never press both pedals

00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:58.211
at the same time. You can adjust your cart seat
by pulling up the red strap between your legs

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:02.774
and moving in the desired direction. Adjust
the steering wheel by pulling the black knob

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:08.857
below it and adjust the pedals by firmly pressing
the green button below the black knob. Remember

00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:14.640
to fasten your seatbelt before driving. When
signaled by the pit crew, start your cart by

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.504
releasing the pedals and pressing the blue button
once. Perform a brake test by driving up to

00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:26.024
the pit crew with the red flag and coming to
a complete stop. Continue onto the track once

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:32.414
the crew lowers the flag. To reverse, first
release all pedals and make sure no car is

00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:36.441
nearby. Then hold down the blue button and slowly
press the accelerator.

00:01:40.778 --> 00:01:45.364
When you see the blue flag, move to the side
of the track and let the other driver overtake

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:51.272
you on the inside of the turn. If you nudge
other drivers or crash into the barriers, you

00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:56.499
will get a warning flag. If you repeat this
behavior, you will be disqualified with a black flag.

00:02:02.274 --> 00:02:06.657
The end of the race is indicated by red lights
along the track. When you see them blinking,

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:12.702
slowly drive into the pit lane. Never exit the
vehicle outside of the pit lane. If you need

00:02:12.742 --> 00:02:18.727
assistance, stay in the cart and raise your
hand. After the briefing, look for your picture

00:02:18.747 --> 00:02:27.085
on the TV screens and take a seat in the cart
with your number. You're all set. Good luck and have fun.
